  <p id="spiral-writeup">We wanted to explore the relationship between gender and marijuana and alcohol use to identify behavioral patterns before diving into how substance use might correlate with criminal justice involvement. This graph visualizes the number of days people reported using alcohol or marijuana in the past 30 days, split by gender. We excluded responses where the number of days was zero in order to focus specifically on individuals who do use these substances.
    <br><br>As you hover over the graph, you’ll notice that the most common number of drinking days for women is 1, while for men it’s 2 days, double the amount for women. This gap is small but meaningful. On average, men reported drinking 8.4 days per month, while women reported 5.6 days, showing a clear difference in regularity between genders.
    <br><br>For marijuana, a much different pattern emerges. Among men, the most common response is 30 days, suggesting daily use and potential dependency. In contrast, women are most likely to report just 1 day of use, similar to the trend seen with alcohol. However, the average number of days men used marijuana was 14.2, compared to 11.0 for women, which is higher than their respective alcohol averages. This suggests that among those who use marijuana, it is often used more intensely than alcohol, particularly by men.
    <br><br>Even though marijuana users report higher average usage, alcohol still appears to be more socially normalized across the broader population. Looking at how many people actually consumed each substance in the past 30 days highlights this clearly: 6,837 men and 6,217 women reported drinking alcohol, while only 2,624 men and 1,825 women reported using marijuana. So while marijuana users may use it more frequently, alcohol is used by far more people overall. This suggests that marijuana may still carry social stigma, despite its legalization in many states. It’s also possible that marijuana use is underreported more than alcohol, due to lingering legal or cultural concerns. The spiral graphs help visualize not only the frequency of use, but also how patterns differ by gender and by substance.
