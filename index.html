<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p id="article-format">Understanding the intricate interplay between gender, mental illness, substance use, and criminal
  behavior is
  essential to addressing broader issues of public health and social justice. Our project aims to visualize these
  relationships using the "Gender, Mental Illness, and Crime in the United States, 2004" dataset from ICPSR, which draws
  from the extensive National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). With over 55,000 participants and thousands of
  variables, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to uncover patterns in how mental health conditions and substance
  use differ across genders and correlate with criminal behavior, including arrests and charges. Through targeted
  visualizations, we seek to illuminate how these complex factors intersect, ultimately shedding light on systemic
  disparities and informing data-driven discussions around criminal justice and public health policy.</p>

<h4><em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em></h4>
<p id="article-format">
  We performed an exploratory data analysis because not only is the data set extremely big, it is essential to clean and
  preprocess the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency in the visualization. Many of the original values in the
  dataset used special codes such as 91 (indicating "0 days") and 93–99 (representing various forms of missing or
  invalid data), which needed to be recoded or filtered out. For example, values like 91 were converted to 0, while 93
  and above were treated as null to avoid skewing the analysis. This cleaning process helped reduce noise in the data
  and allowed for meaningful comparisons across different demographic and behavioral segments. By transforming raw
  survey responses into a structured format, the analysis became more robust and insights into patterns of depression in
  relation to substance use and arrests became more apparent.

<h1 class="spiral-title">Exploring Gender Differences in Alcohol and Marijuana Use</h1>
<p id="article-format">We wanted to explore the relationship between gender and marijuana and alcohol use to identify
  behavioral patterns before diving into how substance use might correlate with criminal justice involvement. This
  graph visualizes the number of days people reported using alcohol or marijuana in the past 30 days, split by gender.
  We excluded responses where the number of days was zero in order to focus specifically on individuals who do use
  these substances.
  <br><br>The graph displays the number of days individuals reported using alcohol or marijuana within a 30-day
  period, separated by gender. We chose a spiral format to make differences in frequency visually intuitive, and to
  make patterns like occasional versus daily use stand out clearly. To support deeper exploration, we added tooltips
  that appear when hovering over each section. These show the exact number of respondents for a given substance,
  gender, and usage level, offering more detailed insight beyond what’s visible at a glance.
</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Key Findings</h4>
<p id="article-format">
  As you hover over the graph, you’ll notice that the most common number of drinking days for women is 1,
  while for men it’s 2 days, double the amount for women. This gap is small but meaningful. On average, men reported
  drinking 8.4 days per month, while women reported 5.6 days, showing a clear difference in regularity between
  genders.
  <br><br>For marijuana, a much different pattern emerges. Among men, the most common response is 30 days, suggesting
  daily use and potential dependency. In contrast, women are most likely to report just 1 day of use, similar to the
  trend seen with alcohol. However, the average number of days men used marijuana was 14.2, compared to 11.0 for
  women, which is higher than their respective alcohol averages. This suggests that among those who use marijuana, it
  is often used more intensely than alcohol, particularly by men.
  <br><br>Even though marijuana users report higher average usage, alcohol still appears to be more socially
  normalized across the broader population. Looking at how many people actually consumed each substance in the past 30
  days highlights this clearly: 6,837 men and 6,217 women reported drinking alcohol, while only 2,624 men and 1,825
  women reported using marijuana. So while marijuana users may use it more frequently, alcohol is used by far more
  people overall. This suggests that marijuana may still carry social stigma, despite its legalization in many states.
  It’s also possible that marijuana use is underreported more than alcohol, due to lingering legal or cultural
  concerns. The spiral graphs help visualize not only the frequency of use, but also how patterns differ by gender and
  by substance.

  <h1>Correlation Matrix Heatmap by Gender</h1>
  <p id="article-format">We wanted to see the correlation between depression frequency and various behavioral and social
    factors, such as
    substance use, work absenteeism, and criminal justice involvement, with a focus on gender differences.
    We decided to implement a heatmap for this data visualization because it effectively displays the relationship
    between the three variables at once. We created two side-by-side heatmaps (one for males and one for females) to
    explore these relationships. The y-axis of each heatmap represents the number of times an individual was arrested
    and booked in the past 12 months, while the x-axis (selectable via dropdown) allows users to examine different
    variables: number of days alcohol was consumed, chewing tobacco was used, marijuana was consumed, or work was missed
    within the past 30 days. The values on the x-axis were grouped into ranges to simplify the visualization and enhance
    interpretability. The color of each cell indicates the average depression frequency for individuals in that group,
    where blue reflects lower depression frequency and red reflects higher depression frequency. This visualization is
    important because it helps uncover patterns in mental health outcomes across gender and behavioral dimensions,
    allowing researchers and policymakers to identify high-risk populations and inform targeted interventions.
    <br><br>
  <h4>Key Findings</h4>

  <p id="article-format">From looking at our heatmaps, we noticed a trend that through all the variables (alcohol,
    tobacco, marijuana, and
    work days missed), the color scheme in the Depression Frequency seemed to be more shades of red in the bottom left
    corner and blue in the top right corner. This means that people were more likely to be depressed even if they did
    not consume any alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or didn’t miss any days of work in the past 30 days, and that this
    causation of depression is more likely due to being arrested in the past 12 months.

  <h1>Impact of Substance Use on Probation, Parole, and Arrest Rates</h1>
  <p id="article-format">
    This bar graph animates through different harder drugs to show the relationship between reported use and involvement
    in the criminal justice system. For each drug, it compares the percentage of people who said they have ever used it
    to those who have not, highlighting how many in each group have been arrested, placed on probation, or parole.
    <br><br>To help focus attention on one substance at a time, the graph shows two bars per drug (one for users and one
    for non-users) rather than displaying all six substances side-by-side at once. This allows viewers to see the stark
    contrast within each pair without getting overwhelmed by visual clutter. The y-axis represents the percentage of
    justice-involved individuals (either been arrested, placed on probation, or parole) with the axis going up to 100%,
    while the x-axis simply distinguishes between “Used” and “Never Used.” The animation cycles through each substance
    automatically every few seconds, with the corresponding drug name displayed clearly at the top, reinforcing which
    substance is being analyzed.
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h4>Key Findings</h4>
  <p id="article-format">
    Across all six substances (PCP, Ecstasy, Heroin, Cocaine, Crack, and LSD), the same pattern emerges:
    individuals who reported using the substance at least once were significantly more likely to have had criminal
    justice involvement.
    <br><br>For example, only 15.0% of those who never used PCP had been arrested, on probation, or parole, compared to
    54.2% of users. The same disparity appears with heroin (15.3% vs. 62.1%), crack (14.4% vs. 62.7%), and cocaine
    (11.7% vs. 46.1%). Even for drugs that are sometimes perceived as less "serious," like LSD and ecstasy, the
    differences are still stark: LSD users were nearly four times as likely (48.8%) to have justice involvement than
    non-users (12.7%), and ecstasy users showed a 43.2% rate compared to just 13.9% among non-users.
    <br><br>This visualization helps illustrate that the strongest predictor of justice involvement among these groups
    isn’t necessarily which drug was used, but whether any of them were used at all. While this doesn’t imply direct
    causation, it points to how drug use often overlaps with other life circumstances that increase the likelihood of
    interacting with the justice system.

  <h1>Depression Analysis</h1>
  <p id="article-format">
    This bar graph illustrates the relationship between adults' overall severity of major depressive episode (MDE)
    interference in daily life ASDSOVRL and the average number of times they were arrested and booked in the past 12
    months (NOBOOKY2).
    The x-axis categorizes individuals by their reported depression interference levels, ranging from 1 (no
    interference)
    to 5 (severe interference), while the y-axis shows the corresponding average number of arrests.

    <br><br>From the graph, we observe that individuals with minimal or no depression interference (level 1)
    reported the highest average number of arrests. Interestingly, as the severity of depression interference increases,
    the average number of arrests decreases, with the lowest arrest rate seen at the highest interference level (level
    5).

    <br><br>This trend suggests that individuals experiencing more severe mental health challenges may have less
    involvement with the criminal justice system, possibly due to reduced mobility, support from health services, or
    other social factors that limit engagement in arrest-related behavior.

    <br><br>This data highlights a counterintuitive but important insight: less visible mental
    health struggles might coincide with more externalized behaviors like arrest, while those facing more
    intense internal struggles may be more withdrawn or supervised.

  <h1>Depression Levels Among Individuals With & Without Mental Health Challenges</h1>
  <p id="article-format">
    This grouped histogram displays how often individuals reported feeling depressed during their worst month
    (DSTDEPRS),
    separated by whether they reported experiencing mental or emotional difficulties (HLTINMNT).

    <br><br>The x-axis represents depression frequency scores (1 = least often, 5 = most often).
    The y-axis shows the number of individuals who gave each score.
    Bars are grouped by difficulty status:
    Blue = individuals who reported mental/emotional difficulties
    Orange = individuals who did not report such difficulties

    <br><br>The chart highlights a clear pattern: those with higher depression frequency scores (4 and 5) were
    much more likely to report mental or emotional difficulties. Conversely, individuals with lower depression
    frequency scores reported fewer difficulties.

    <br><br>This pattern underscores the relationship between depression severity and self-reported emotional
    struggles, suggesting that those who experience depressive episodes more frequently are more likely to
    acknowledge broader mental or emotional challenges.
